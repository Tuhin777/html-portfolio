<h2>My Top Three Movies </h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1.Suzume</h3><h4>imdb<p>7.6</p></h4>
<p>Had we not seen these elements before, then I would say "Suzume" is a really good anime. Sadly, precisely because we have seen these elements before, then I have to say "Suzume" is an ok anime only. If you're a fan of Shinkai Makoto - like I am - then you should watch "Suzume" so you can make up your own mind.<p1/>

    <h3>2.Interstellar</h3><h4>imdb<p>8.0</p></h4>
<p>When Earth becomes uninhabitable in the future, a farmer and ex-NASA pilot, Joseph Cooper, is tasked to pilot a spacecraft, along with a team of researchers, to find a new planet for humans.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>3.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 </h3><h4>imdb<p>8.1</p></h4>
<p>Still reeling from the loss of Gamora, Peter Quill rallies his team to defend the universe and one of their own - a mission that could mean the end of the Guardians if not successful</p>
